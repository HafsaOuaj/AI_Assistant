# AI Assistant for Data Science Projects

Welcome to the AI Assistant project! ðŸ¤– In this series, we are developing an AI assistant using Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone. This AI assistant is designed to streamline your data science projects by helping with tasks such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model selection, prediction, and even offering a chatbox for interaction.
